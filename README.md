See [the example file](_data/1718/mjsolidarios.md), copy it and replace its contents with your own **emoji** (see [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), **about_me** and **hugot_lines/inspirational_quotes /other_stuffs**.

## Notes

Being able to use git is a very essential skill for app developers. Even though this lesson is not officially added in our curriculum or in our actual course outline, I'm posting this as your homework so you may able to use it as well in the future. To learn more about git, please visit [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/why-git) from Atlassian.

Use git, save lives!
